Project Summary - 
Paisabazaar is a leading financial services platform that helps customers discover and apply for a wide range of banking and credit products. A core component of its operations is evaluating customer creditworthiness, which plays a vital role in loan approval, risk management, and personalized financial recommendations. Credit scores serve as a key indicator for financial institutions to assess an individual’s likelihood of repaying borrowed funds.

This project focuses on analyzing customer financial data and building a predictive model to classify individuals’ credit scores. By leveraging features such as income levels, credit card utilization, repayment history, and payment behavior, the model aims to accurately assess credit risk. Effective credit score classification can help Paisabazaar enhance its decision-making processes, minimize loan default risks, and provide tailored financial guidance to customers.

The outcome of this case study is a data-driven credit score prediction system that supports improved credit assessment, optimizes lending strategies, and strengthens customer trust through more reliable and transparent financial evaluations.
